# Transfer Learning & CNN classification - Assignment 3
This repository contains all of the code and data related to the third assignment for my portfolio exam in the Spring 2022 module **Visual Analytics** which is a part 
of my tilvalg in Cultural Data Science at Aarhus University.  

This repository is in active development, with new material being pushed on regularly from now and until **19th may 2022**.

## Assignment description 
In this assignment, I'll be working with the CIFAR10 dataset and build a classifier using transfer learning with a pretrained CNN like VGG16 for feature extraction. 

Your ```.py``` script should minimally do the following:

- Load the CIFAR10 dataset
- Use VGG16 to perform feature extraction
- Train a classifier 
- Save plots of the loss and accuracy 
- Save the classification report

## Goal
- The purpose of this assignment is to show that I am able to use transfer learning in the context of image data, a state-of-the-art task in deep learning
- This assignment is also intended to increase your familiarity of working with ```Tensorflow/Keras```, and with building complex deep learning pipelines
- After completing this assignment, you will have the basic outline of a classification pipeline using transfer learning which can be adapted and modified for future tasks

## Technicalities 
The coding part of this repository will be run on Python. 

## Repo Structure  
This repository has the following directory structure:  

| **Folder** | **Description** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ```input``` | Input data |
| ```output``` | Output data |
| ```src``` | Python scripts |
