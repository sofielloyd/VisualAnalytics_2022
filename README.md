# Visual Analytics - Spring 2022

## Portfolio description
This repository contains all of the code and data related to my portfolio exam in the Spring 2022 module **Visul Analytics** which is a part of my tilvalg in Cultural Data Science at Aarhus University.  

The visual analytics portfolio consists of 4 projects; 3 class assignments + 1 self-assigned.

This repository is in active development, with new material being pushed on regularly until **19th may 2022**.  



## Usage
Every folder in this repository is structred with the following sub-folders; ```input```, ```output```, ```src```. Some of the assignments also contains a ```utils``` folder.   
Furthermore, the folders contains a ```README.md``` which gives a further description of the assignment and the current folder, and a ```requirements.txt``` which contain a list of what should be install in order to run the scripts.  

- The ```input``` folders are empty and this is where you should upload your own data, if you want to reproduce the code. The input data that I have used for the given code is described in the ```README.md```.

- The ```output``` folders contains my results and it is this folder that you should save your own results when replicating the code. 

- The ```src``` folders contains the code written in ```.py``` scripts. 

- The ```utils``` folders contains a collection of small Python functions which make common patterns shorter and easier. The utils scripts used in this project were developed in-class and can also be found in [this](https://github.com/CDS-AU-DK/cds-visual.git) repository.
