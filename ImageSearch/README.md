# Image Search - Assignment 1
This repository contains all of the code and data related to the first assignment for my portfolio exam in the Spring 2022 module **Visual Analytics** which is a part 
of my tilvalg in Cultural Data Science at Aarhus University.  

This repository is in active development, with new material being pushed on regularly from now and until **19th may 2022**.

## Assignment description 
Write a small Python program to compare image histograms quantitively using Open-CV and the other image processing tools you've already encountered.  

My script should do the following:
- Take a user-defined image from the folder
- Calculate the "distance" between the colour histogram of that image and all of the others.
- Find which 3 image are most "similar" to the target image.
- Save an image which shows the target image, the three most similar, and the calculated distance score.
- Save a CSV which has one column for the filename and three columns showing the filenames of the closest images in descending order

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate that I have a good understanding of how to use simple image processing techniques to extract valuable information 
from image data.

## Technicalities 
The coding part of this repository will be run on Python. 

## Repo Structure  
This repository has the following directory structure:  

| **Folder** | **Description** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ```input``` | Input data |
| ```output``` | Output data |
| ```src``` | Python scripts |
