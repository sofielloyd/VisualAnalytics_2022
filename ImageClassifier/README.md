# Image classifier benchmark scripts - Assignment 2
This repository contains all of the code and data related to the second assignment for my portfolio exam in the Spring 2022 module **Visual Analytics** which is a part 
of my tilvalg in Cultural Data Science at Aarhus University.  

This repository is in active development, with new material being pushed on regularly from now and until **19th may 2022**.

## Assignment description 
Take the classifier pipelines we covered in lecture 7 and turn them into *two separate ```.py``` scripts*. 
Your code should do the following:

- One script should be called ```logistic_regression.py``` and should do the following:
  - Load either the **MNIST_784** data or the **CIFAR_10** data
  - Train a Logistic Regression model using ```scikit-learn```
  - Print the classification report to the terminal **and** save the classification report to ```out/lr_report.txt```
- Another scripts should be called ```nn_classifier.py``` and should do the following:
  - Load either the **MNIST_784** data or the **CIFAR_10** data
  - Train a Neural Network model using the premade module in ```neuralnetwork.py```
  - Print output to the terminal during training showing epochs and loss
  - Print the classification report to the terminal **and** save the classification report to ```out/nn_report.txt```

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate that I know how to create ```.py``` scripts with simple classifiers that can act as benchmarks for future reasearch.

## Technicalities 
The coding part of this repository will be run on Python. 

## Repo Structure  
This repository has the following directory structure:  

| **Folder** | **Description** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ```input``` | Input data |
| ```output``` | Output data |
| ```src``` | Python scripts |
